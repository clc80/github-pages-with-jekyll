# Welcome to my blog

I would like to contribute to open source software and getting comfortable with **GitHub** feels like a great way to start. 

Next steps will be: 
1 Find a project that seems easy enough to work on  
2 Figure out how to actually download the project
3 Work on the project
4 Push the project and hope I did it right.
